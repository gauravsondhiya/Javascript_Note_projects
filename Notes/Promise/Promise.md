# Promise

A promise in JavaScript is a way to handle asynchronous operations. It's like a "promise" you make to do something in the future. It has three states:

1. Pending: The promise is still in progress.
2. Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
3. Rejected: The operation failed.

Promises allow you to write cleaner and more organized code, avoiding "callback hell." You can use .then() to handle success and .catch() to handle errors.

In simple terms, a promise helps you manage tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server, and ensures you know when it's done or if something went wrong.
